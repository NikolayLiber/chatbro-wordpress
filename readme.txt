Chat for your community with social networks integration. Syncronizes chat conversation with Telegram messenger. Allows your visitors to chat online in live group chat with you and each other. Skyrocket user engagement and overall time spent on your website.

== Description ==

Live group chat for your website.

Chat conversation is being syncronized with conversation in VK/Telegram messengers. Join it via chat menu and talk to your website visitors from VK/Telegram messenger. Conversation history is saved and can be added to your website for further indexing by search robots. Add our robot to an existing VK/Telegram conversation to get it's history on your website for search engine indexing.

Admins find it convenient to answer users questions by mobile phone using a VK/Telegram application.

= Features =

* chat history is indexed by search robots
* reveals photo and video
* asynchronous loading - no influence exerted on your website
* mobile ready
* authentication via your website, Vkontakte or Telegram
* moderation by chat owner
* website chat synchronized with Vkontakte or Telegram chat

= Live group chat is better than chat with operators =

Unlike private chat with consultants, live group chat between all website users and the administration appears to be more trustworthy. People communicate and see admin's reaction and realize that the website is functional and adequate.

You still can chat with client in private if needed.

= Increases search traffic, user engagement and overall time spent on the website =

The chat history is unique content on your subject. Search engines index it and provide targeted traffic. If you was the first one who submited unique content to the search engine, and the content matched a rare user query, you will hold the first position on this query.

= Easy installation =

After installing the plugin just name your conversation and choose messenger to syncronize with (VK or Telegram).

= Customization =

Chat could be easily configured with plugin extended parameters.
You can choose color theme, size, initial state, etc.
